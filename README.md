## **APPJAMMING SUMMIT PROJECT - SPORTCONNECT**

We believe that by exercising and sharing results, people can connect with each other during the pandemic. Therefore, we design SportConnect, a website where everyone can take part in fitness challenges and share results with your friends. There are many different challenges, from fitness challenges like pushups to sport challenges like long-distance running.

## Features

 - View Challenges to take part in them
 - View a tutorial on how to do exercises in the challenges
 - View others doing the challenges and like them
 - Submit your challenges (working)
 - An account system to submit challenges (working)

## Goals

 1. To create a website for people to submit their workout results and connect with each other
 2. To promote workout and give motivation for everyone

## To-do list

 1. Implement a Level system to promote people to do exercises
 2. More challenges and a profile feature
 3. Finding challenges by category (muscle training, yoga, cardio...)
